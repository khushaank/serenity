# Serenity

Calming ambient radio player and guided breathing exercise web application.

## About

Serenity is a simple, single-page web application designed to help you relax, focus, or sleep. It combines soothing internet radio streams (Jazz, Classical, Nature, Ambient) with a gentle visual breathing rhythm.

## Features

- **Curated Radio Streams**: Switch between high-quality streams like Stereoscenic Jazz, KUSC Classical, Birdsong Radio, and Ambient Sleeping Pill.
- **Breathing Exercise**: Follow the visual circle to regulate your breathing (4-second inhale, 4-second exhale).
- **Background Video**: Calming, looped video background (blurs when music plays for focus).
- **Offline Capable**: Works offline via Service Worker integration.
- **Privacy First**: No tracking, no ads, no cookies.
